# Loan Approval Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This repo contains the Loan Approval Prediction project as part of my data science portfolio.This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant data. Using a Logistic Regression model, we analyze key factors such as income, credit history, loan amount, and other demographics to classify loan status as approved or rejected.
This project covers the whole process from problem statement to model development and evaluation:


## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights
- **Problem Statement:** Predict loan approval based on applicant information.
- **Dataset:** Publicly available or custom-prepared loan dataset.
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression (Supervised Classification).
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature Engineering
  - Model Building and Evaluation
  - Prediction on New Data
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-approval-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd loan-approval-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to run the project.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Achieved an accuracy of **X%** on the test dataset.
- Identified key factors such as applicant income, credit history, and loan amount as influential features for loan approval.
